# Wordle-Buddy
Wordle Buddy will help you solve today's Wordle puzzle or similar 5-letter word guessing game.

Simply enter the information you already know from past guesses or use Wordle Buddy to generate a good first guess. Wordle Buddy uses statistics and the information you provide about which letters you know and are in the right place (green letters) and letters that you know are in the word, but now their location (yellow letters) and which letters could be in the word (letters that are not grayed out). Once this information is entered and confirmed, the file possible_guesses will contain a list of 5-letter words in order by how good of a guess Wordle Buddy thinks it is. Guesses are scored based on how often each letter is used in English words and whether or not the word repeats letters since guesses that don't repeat letters give you more information about what letters are and aren't in the secret word. 

Keep in mind that scores are only based on statistics and that the dictionary Wordle Buddy pulls from contains many 5-letter words that are probably not going to be used by Wordle, so it is up to you to choose your favorite guess from the list of "possible" guesses. Assuming the correct information is provided, any word in possible_guesses.txt should be a valid guess regardless of score.
